Objective
---------
With the intention of testing my skill on Ruby on Rails, this application uses 
a set of the most popular gems to develop a complex web application with ease.

About
-----

This application uses the [Heroku][heroku_url] cloud platform as 
its deployment server. [Click here][app_url] to 
see the application working.

As for the test environment two main gems are being used: [RSpec][rspec_url] 
and [Capybara][capybara_url]. The first one is used for the unit and 
functional tests and the latest is used for behaviour test.

The methodology used to write this application is the Behaviour Driven 
Development. When new features are created first it's designed the expected 
behaviour of the application and afterwards the code is written.
